Pustakalaya
===========

Pustakalaya is a network of book readers in Kathmandu city who all share a common love and interest for reading. This network enables the registered users to connect with other like-minded peers and share books amongst them. Pustakalaya is a dynamic community based repository. Here, everybody is a donor, and everybody is a receiver. In a city where buying and owning books is a luxury that most of the students/enthusiasts can't afford, Pustakalaya provides them with a one click solution for reading the books they desire at their own abode.
